Okay so I am poor now
But I still want to listen to music
I don't want to listen to ads
And I don't have money for premium services
So the natural solution is to self-host a streaming service?

### Self-hosted music streaming services
-Ampache
    AGPLv3
    API apparently compatible with Plex
- Jellyfin
    GPLv2
    Web, various client platforms
    Extensive plugin ecosystems
- Navidrome
    GPLv3
    Web interface + Mobile (iOS, Android)
- Plex/Plexamp
    Closed/Licensed software
    Mobile app, Plex website
    Apparently closest to Spotify/Apple Music
    Setup, offline playback and telemtry may be difficult
- Lyrion
    GPL
    Web interface
    Multi-room sync

### What do I want?
#### Non-negotiable
Offline playback on iPhone
#### I would prefer
Great listening statistics
Switch songs quickly
#### Nice to have
Search for songs that aren't downloaded
Some form of smart shuffle

### What can I do?
I have a personal server running 24/7
I have several unused laptops that I could easily set up as microservers
