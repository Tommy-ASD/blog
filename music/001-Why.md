Okay so I am poor now
But I still want to listen to music
I don't want to listen to ads
And I don't have money for premium services
So the natural solution is to self-host a streaming service?

### Self-hosted music streaming services
-Ampache
    AGPLv3
    API apparently compatible with Plex
- Jellyfin
    GPLv2
    Web, various client platforms
    Extensive plugin ecosystems
- Navidrome
    GPLv3
    Web interface + Mobile (iOS, Android)
- Plex/Plexamp
    Closed/Licensed software
    Mobile app, Plex website
    Apparently closest to Spotify/Apple Music
    Setup, offline playback and telemtry may be difficult
- Lyrion
    GPL
    Web interface
    Multi-room sync

What do I want?
I want great tracking of what it is I listen to - I like analyzing listening statistics
I want to be able to switch songs at a moments' notice, through a relatively clean UI
It would be nice to have some sort of smart shuffle, but I don't know how feasible this is
Also searching for songs, but same as before, not sure about feasibility
Most important is offline playback on my iPhone
