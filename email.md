# I decided to try to set up an e-mail service on my server
## Not for any particular reason, just because it'd be funny
### Ok maybe slightly because I wanted to feel cool getting crontab reports on my e-mail
To clarify; I know nearly nothing about how the e-mail system works, but this experience has sparked my interest for it.

### Installing Postfix and Mailutils
First things first, I had to install and set up the required software. This was Postfix and Mailutils.
Postfix is a mail transfer agent (MTA for short) used to send and receive e-meials, and Mailutils provides tools for handling e-mails from the command line. How these pieces of software work, I don't yet know, but I plan to dig deeper into that.

```

After installing postfix and mailutils, I had to set my system hostname;
### Setting up necessary config on the server
Postfix and Mailutils require a hostname to work properly;
```
tommy@server:~$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname tommyasd.com
tommy@server:~$ hostname
tommyasd.com
tommy@server:~$ echo "127.0.0.1 tommyasd.com mail" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
tommy@server:~$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 server

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

127.0.0.1 tommyasd.com mail
tommy@tommyasd:~$
```

### Setting up SPF and DMARC
![Image showing my DNS-records](image.png)

At this point, I believe I could have tried to send a test email, but it would be marked as spam. Again, I know little of how e-mail works, but with my limited knowledge I believe just about anyone can send an e-mail from any address. For e-mail clients to be sure the mail is coming from a safe and legitimate source, they use a combination of SPF, DMARC and DKIM

To avoid this, I had to set up a DMARC and SPF record, and later on a DKIM pair.

#### SPF

My SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record is `v=spf1 a:tommyasd.com include:_spf.domeneshop.no ~all`. 

An SPF record specifies which e-mail servers are authorized to send e-mails on behalf of a domain. Breaking my record down;

`v=spf1` specifies the version of SPF used.

`a:tommyasd.com` specifies that the e-mail server with the IP that tommyasd.com points to can send e-mails. Essentially, the server which tommyasd.com points to is allowed to send e-mails.

`include:_spf.domeneshop.no` appends the SPF rules defined by _spf.domeneshop.no. Essentially, any e-mail server authorized by DomainNameShop is authorized to send e-mails on behalf of tommyasd.com.

The final part defines how to handle mail that doesn't come from an authorized server. In this case, the Tilde `~` signifies a **soft fail**. E-mails from unauthorized servers aren't outright rejected, but should be marked as suspicious.

SPF is a critical part of e-mail, ensuring that the received e-mail comes from an authorized server for the domain.

#### DMARC

My DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) record is `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:postmaster@tommyasd.com`. Breaking this down;

`v=DMARC1`, similarly to SPF, specifies the version of DMARC used.

`p=quarantine` defines what should be done when an e-mail fails DMARC authentication. As far as I'm aware, there are three options;

- None 

    No action will be taken and e-mails that fail DMARC will be delivered as usual. 

- Quarantine

    E-mails that fail DMARC are marked as spam.

- Reject

    E-mails that fail DMARC are rejected completely, never being delivered to the recipient.

`rua=mailto:postmaster@tommyasd.com` specifies where DMARC aggregate reports should be sent. These reports are sent by receiving mail servers (like Gmail or Microsoft 365), summarizing how many domains succeeded or failed DMARC checks for my domain. In this case, postmaster@tommyasd.com will receive these reports. (Sidenote, rua stands for `Reporting URI for Aggregate Reports`)


That was a lot, but initial setup is done! Now that we're through that, we can finally try sending an e-mail from the terminal!
### Sending an e-mail

tommy@tommyasd:~$
```
Based on the terminal output, the e-mail seems to have been sent successfully. Let's check my e-mail;

![Image showing my inbox, notably not including the expected sent e-mail](inbox.png)

Hmmm, strange. The e-mail doesn't show up. Maybe it'll show up in sent mail?

![Image showing my sent mail, again notably not including the expected sent e-mail](sent.png)

Well my knowledge of e-mail is limited, but I do think it would be weird if it showed up in sent mail, as it was sent from the server instead of DomainNameShop webmail.

Okay, last spot I haven't checked is the spam folder. Let's check that out, then;

![Image showing my completely empty spam folder](spam.png)

Not in spam, either. Huh.


Maybe because the sending and receiving address are the same? I'll try sending to my gmail, then.
```

Logs again indicate it was sent successfully. Checking my e-mail;

![Image showing the e-mail received in gmail](received.png)

Okay, great! The e-mail was received on the other end. Maybe the problem was sending and receiving addresses being the same?
To test this theory, I tried sending a mail to one of my other e-mails, tommy@funnyduck.no;
```

Hmmm. `Dec  8 04:58:39 server postfix/smtp[1441505]: 557C5A4A0F0: host mx.domeneshop.no[2a01:5b40:0:2204::1] said: 451 4.7.3 Please try again later. IP greylisted.` My IP is greylisted? 
After a quick Google search, I learned that this is a technique by mail servers to temporarily reject emails from unknown senders. Apparently, spammers won't retry sending an e-mail after the rejection, while legitimate servers will. Apparently, waiting a while before retrying will let me through.

After about an hour waiting, spending that time writing the beginning of this blog post, I've written all my steps up until this point and can now continue setting up e-mail.

There's some unexpected behaviour involving the decmc account, an account used for our December Minecraft server (which also never arrived). Strange. I'll have to check that out later, but first;
Seems like it automatically retried sending the e-mail! Fantastic! Curious how DomainNameShop still displays the mail as received at 04:58 when I first ran the command, but I guess I'll learn why eventually

### Recap time. 
So far we've;

Installed postfix and mailutils.

Configured hostname and similar on the server

Set up SPF and DMARC records for my domain name

Attempted to send an e-mail from `tommy@tommyasd.com` to `tommy@tommyasd.com`, which never arrived

Sent an e-mail from `tommy@tommyasd.com` to my personal gmail account, which worked immediately

Sent an e-mail from `tommy@tommyasd.com` to `tommy@funnyduck.no`, which initially got rejected due to greylisting, but after mailutils (I assume?) retried about half an hour later, it came through

Sent another e-mail from `tommy@tommyasd.com` to `tommy@funnyduck.no`, which after I was un-greylisted, immediately arrived


### Fixing the problem of e-mails to tommyasd.com root domain don't arrive
After giving ChatGPT the logs and explaining the problem, it directed my attention toward the line
`Dec  8 04:55:25 server postfix/local[1437489]: B3045A4A0ED: to=<tommy@tommyasd.com>, relay=local, delay=0.01, delays=0/0/0/0, dsn=2.0.0, status=sent (delivered to mailbox)`
More specifically, it told me `postfix/local` and `relay=local` means it is sent to the local mailbox on my server.
Let's check local mailbox to see if they've arrived there, then;
```

Hello from server!

There it is! Great! Seems like it was working just fine the entire time.

Little sidetrack to check what the deal with decmc@tommyasd.com was;
```

The mail was about crontab results? But I haven't set up any crontab jobs which involve sending e-mails?
The only jobs I have in crontab are;

`0 * * * * zip -r /mnt/mass/decmc/backups/world.$(date +\%Y\%m\%d\%H\%M\%S).zip ~/world`

`0 * * * * borg create --stats /mnt/mass/decmc/borg_repo::$(date +\%Y\%m\%d\%H\%M\%S) ~/world >> ~/borg_backup.log 2>&1`

Quick run by ChatGPT says cron will automatically send the output. I guess that's fine, I won't do anything about that.


#### Okay setting up e-mail server has been fun, but I did pull an all-nighter, and I am very tired now. I'll keep going later on.

#### Day later
Sending mail from server works wonders, but can I receive mail on the server, too? 
Testing this, I tried sending an e-mail from my Gmail account to tommy@tommyasd.com

![Image showing me sending an e-mail from my personal Gmail account to tommy@tommyasd.com](sent_from_gmail.png)

Mail sent, let's see whether it arrived on the server;

```
tommy@tommyasd:~$ mail
No mail for tommy
tommy@tommyasd:~$
```

That doesn't seem to have worked, I assume because it's still being received at DomainNameShop. Checking there;
